                                    A mutual fund/unit fund is formed by collecting savings from many investors. The

                                    The return generated by these securities are passed to you as dividend and capital
                                    gain.

                                    consistently in long term. In the world, by mutual fund investor understands unit

                                    world. In very short term, like less than one year, there are many factors including
                                    market phycology, manipulation, macro-economic factors etc. that affect the stock

                                            Expected active return generally depends on two things- a) skill of the
                                            asset manager, and b) investment strategy of asset manager.

                                            Ekush’s investment philosophy is value investing with long term orientation.
                                            It is considered solid, time proven and safest investment approach in the
                                            world.

                                            <li>Tax savings: This is automatic return. Whenever, you invest in Ekush
                                                managed fund, you will get tax rebate like Sanchaypatra immediately. On
                                                an average you can save 3% - 10% tax expenses (depending up on
                                                individual tax circumstances) just investing in Ekush managed fund.</li>

                                        <p class="">In summary, you save tax first, then Fixed Income portion provides

                                            return expectation from any mutual funds.
                                            And there is no guarantee that Mutual Fund investment portfolio will always
                                            generate profit or gain- there can be losses, too.

                                    A fund’s NAV goes up or down depending on change in market value of the assets held by the fund. Therefore, if the market value of the assets falls substantially, there is a chance of the NAV going below the face value of the fund. However, such events are expected to be temporary as NAV is projected to grow in the long term with expert portfolio management.
